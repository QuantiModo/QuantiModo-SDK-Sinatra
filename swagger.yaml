  description: "Welcome to QuantiModo API! QuantiModo makes it easy to retrieve normalized\
    \ user data from a wide array of devices and applications. [Learn about QuantiModo](https://quantimo.do)\
    \ or contact us at <api@quantimo.do>.\n\nBefore you get started, you will need\
    \ to:\n* Sign in/Sign up, and add some data at [https://quantipress.quantimo.do/import-data/](https://quantipress.quantimo.do/import-data/)\
    \ to try out the API for yourself\n* As long as you're signed in, it will use\
    \ your browser's cookie for authentication.  However, client applications must\
    \ use OAuth2 tokens to access the API.\n\n## Social Authentication flow with JWT\
    \ Token\nHere is the flow for how social authentication works with JWT Token:\n\
    \nSupported Providers:\n * facebook\n * google\n * twitter\n\n1.**Client:** Need\
    \ to open popup with social auth url (`https://app/quantimo.do/api/v2/auth/social/login?provider={provider}&redirectUrl={url}`)\
    \ of server with `provider` and `redirectUrl` (Url should be registered with our\
    \ social apps. Facebook and Twitter are fine with any redirect url with the same\
    \ domain base url but Google needs exact redirect url)\n\n2.**Server:** Server\
    \ will redirect user to that provider to get access\n\n3.**Client:** After successful\
    \ or failed authentication, it will be redirected to given `redirectUrl` with\
    \ code or error\n\n4.**Client:** Client need to get that code and need to send\
    \ Ajax request to server on `https://app.quantimo.do/api/v2/auth/social/authorizeCode?provider={provider}&code={authorizationCode}`\n\
    \n5.**Server:** Server will authorize that code from social connection and will\
    \ authenticate user and will retrieve user info\n\n6.**Server:** Server will try\
    \ to find existing user by unique identity. If user exist then it will do a login\
    \ for that or it will create new user and will do login\n\n7.**Server:** Once\
    \ user is found/created, it will return a JWT token for that user in response\n\
    \n\n## Authentication via access token for Native App\nIf you are using native\
    \ authentication via Facebook or Google SDKs then you should use the following\
    \ flow:\n\n1.**Client:** Do a native authentication via Native Mobile app and\
    \ get an access token\n\n2.**Client:** Send Ajax request with provider name and\
    \ access token on `https://app.quantimo.do/api/v2/auth/social/authorizeToken?provider={provider}&accessToken={accessToken}&refreshToken={refreshToken}`\
    \ (`refreshToken` is optional)\n\n3.**Server:** Server will try to get user info\
    \ and will find existing user by unique identity. If user exist then it will do\
    \ a login for that or it will create new user and will do login\n\n4.**Server:**\
    \ Once user is found/created, it will return a JWT token for that user in response\n\
    \n5.**Client:** After getting the JWT token to get a QM access token follow these\
    \ steps and include your JWT token in them as a header (Authorization: Bearer\
    \ **{yourJWThere}**) or as a url parameter (https://app.quantimo.do/api/v2/oauth/authorize?token={yourJWThere}).\n\
    \n## Oauth2 Authentication(QM Access Token)\n* First step is creating an application\
    \ on [https://admin.quantimo.do](https://admin.quantimo.do) so you can have client_id\
    \ and client_secret for testing out/using our api\n* You can implement OAuth2\
    \ authentication to your application using our **OAuth2** endpoints.\n\n### Request\
    \ Authorization Code\nBasically you need to redirect users to `/api/v2/oauth/authorize`\
    \ endpoint to get an authorization code with following parameters:\n* `client_id`\
    \ This is the unique ID that QuantiModo uses to identify your application.\n*\
    \ `scope` Scopes include basic, readmeasurements, and writemeasurements. The `basic`\
    \ scope allows you to read user info (displayname, email, etc). The `readmeasurements`\
    \ scope allows one to read a user's data. The `writemeasurements` scope allows\
    \ you to write user data. Separate multiple scopes by a space.\n* `redirect_uri`\
    \ The redirect URI is the URL within your client application that will receive\
    \ the OAuth2 credentials.\n* `state` An opaque string that is round-tripped in\
    \ the protocol; that is to say, it is returned as a URI parameter in the Basic\
    \ flow, and in the URI.\n* `response_type` If the value is code, launches a Basic\
    \ flow, requiring a POST to the token endpoint to obtain the tokens. If the value\
    \ is token id_token or id_token token, launches an Implicit flow, requiring the\
    \ use of Javascript at the redirect URI to retrieve tokens from the URI #fragment.\n\
    \n### Request Access Token\nAfter user approves your access to the given scope,\
    \ you'll recevive an authorization code to request an access token. This time\
    \ make a `POST` request to `/api/v2/oauth/access_token` with parameters including:\n\
    * `grant_type` Can be `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` since we are getting\
    \ the `access_token` for the first time we don't have a `refresh_token` so this\
    \ must be `authorization_code`.\n* `client_id` The client id you used to receive\
    \ an `authorization_code`.\n* `client_secret` Your client secret which you received\
    \ with the client id.\n* `code` Authorization code you received with the previous\
    \ request.\n* `redirect_uri` Your application's redirect url.\n\n### Refreshing\
    \ Access Token\nAccess tokens expire at some point, to continue using our api\
    \ you need to refresh them with `refresh_token` you received along with the `access_token`.\
    \ To do this make a `POST` request to `/api/v2/oauth/access_token` with correct\
    \ parameters, which are:\n* `grant_type` This time grant type must be `refresh_token`\
    \ since we have it.\n* `client_id` Your application's client id.\n* `client_secret`\
    \ Your application's client secret.\n* `refresh_token` The refresh token you received\
    \ with the `access_token`.\n\nEvery request you make to this endpoint will give\
    \ you a new refresh token and make the old one expired. So you can keep getting\
    \ new access tokens with new refresh tokens.\n### Using Access Token\nCurrently\
    \ we support 2 ways for this, you can't use both at the same time.\n* Adding access\
    \ token to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`\n* Adding\
    \ to the url as a query parameter `?access_token={access_token}`\n\nYou can read\
    \ more about OAuth2 from [here](http://oauth.net/2/)\n\n## Application Endpoints\n\
    These endpoints give you access to all authorized users' data for that application.\n\
    ### Getting Application Token\nMake a `POST` request to `/api/v2/oauth/access_token`\n\
    \ * `grant_type` Must be `client_credentials`.\n * `client_id` Your application's\
    \ client_id.\n * `client_secret` Your application's client_secret.\n * `redirect_uri`\
    \ Your application's redirect url.\n\n## Example Queries\n### Query Options\n\
    The standard query options for QuantiModo API are as described in the table below.\
    \ These are the available query options in QuantiModo API:\n<table>\n    <thead>\n\
    \        <tr>\n            <th>Parameter</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n\
    \        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>limit</td>\n\
    \            <td>The LIMIT is used to limit the number of results returned. So\
    \ if you have 1000 results, but only want to the first 10, you would set this\
    \ to 10 and offset to 0. The maximum limit is 200 records.</td>\n        </tr>\n\
    \        <tr>\n            <td>offset</td>\n            <td>Suppose you wanted\
    \ to show results 11-20. You'd set the offset to 10 and the limit to 10.</td>\n\
    \        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>sort</td>\n            <td>Sort\
    \ by given field. If the field is prefixed with '-', it will sort in descending\
    \ order.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Pagination Conventions\n\
    Since the maximum limit is 200 records, to get more than that you'll have to make\
    \ multiple API calls and page through the results. To retrieve all the data, you\
    \ can iterate through data by using the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.For\
    \ example, if you want to retrieve data from 61-80 then you can use a query with\
    \ the following parameters,\n\n`/v2/variables?limit=20&offset=60`\n\nGenerally,\
    \ you'll be retrieving new or updated user data. To avoid unnecessary API calls,\
    \ you'll want to store your last refresh time locally.  Initially, it should be\
    \ set to 0. Then whenever you make a request to get new data, you should limit\
    \ the returned results to those updated since your last refresh by appending append\n\
    \n`?lastUpdated=(ge)&quot2013-01-D01T01:01:01&quot`\n\nto your request.\n\nAlso\
    \ for better pagination, you can get link to the records of first, last, next\
    \ and previous page from response headers:\n* `Total-Count` - Total number of\
    \ results for given query\n* `Link-First` - Link to get first page records\n*\
    \ `Link-Last` - Link to get last page records\n* `Link-Prev` - Link to get previous\
    \ records set\n* `Link-Next` - Link to get next records set\n\nRemember, response\
    \ header will be only sent when the record set is available. e.g. You will not\
    \ get a ```Link-Last``` & ```Link-Next``` when you query for the last page.\n\n\
    ### Filter operators support\nAPI supports the following operators with filter\
    \ parameters:\n<br>\n**Comparison operators**\n\nComparison operators allow you\
    \ to limit results to those greater than, less than, or equal to a specified value\
    \ for a specified attribute. These operators can be used with strings, numbers,\
    \ and dates. The following comparison operators are available:\n* `gt` for `greater\
    \ than` comparison\n* `ge` for `greater than or equal` comparison\n* `lt` for\
    \ `less than` comparison\n* `le` for `less than or equal` comparison\n\nThey are\
    \ included in queries using the following format:\n\n`(<operator>)<value>`\n\n\
    For example, in order to filter value which is greater than 21, the following\
    \ query parameter should be used:\n\n`?value=(gt)21`\n<br><br>\n**Equals/In Operators**\n\
    \nIt also allows filtering by the exact value of an attribute or by a set of values,\
    \ depending on the type of value passed as a query parameter. If the value contains\
    \ commas, the parameter is split on commas and used as array input for `IN` filtering,\
    \ otherwise the exact match is applied. In order to only show records which have\
    \ the value 42, the following query should be used:\n\n`?value=42`\n\nIn order\
    \ to filter records which have value 42 or 43, the following query should be used:\n\
    \n`?value=42,43`\n<br><br>\n**Like operators**\n\nLike operators allow filtering\
    \ using `LIKE` query. This operator is triggered if exact match operator is used,\
    \ but value contains `%` sign as the first or last character. In order to filter\
    \ records which category that start with `Food`, the following query should be\
    \ used:\n\n`?category=Food%`\n<br><br>\n**Negation operator**\n\nIt is possible\
    \ to get negated results of a query by prefixed the operator with `!`. Some examples:\n\
    \n`//filter records except those with value are not 42 or 43`<br>\n`?value=!42,43`\n\
    \n`//filter records with value not greater than 21`<br>\n`?value=!(ge)21`\n<br><br>\n\
    **Multiple constraints for single attribute**\n\nIt is possible to apply multiple\
    \ constraints by providing an array of query filters:\n\n`// filter all records\
    \ which value is greater than 20.2 and less than 20.3`<br>\n`?value[]=(gt)20.2&value[]=(lt)20.3`\n\
    \n`// filter all records which value is greater than 20.2 and less than 20.3 but\
    \ not 20.2778`<br>\n`?value[]=(gt)20.2&value[]=(lt)20.3&value[]=!20.2778`<br><br>\n"
